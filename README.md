## Reading Guide

For anyone reading this file, I would recommend going through the files in this order:

1. First read the WRI363_Madhav Ajayamohan's Data Story ipnyb file. This Jupiter Notebook:
   1. Gives an introduction to the context of this piece
   2. Goes through how I clean data
   3. Throuoghly analyzes different variables using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
2. If you are interested in learning more about the appendices, you can check out
   1. Check out the Appendices– these describe all the results I obtained from the data
   2. You can also look at the Survey Results csv file
3. I also analyzed this data using an economic perspective– that was actually my first piece of work related to this. If you are interested, read the document Investigation on the Change of Consumption and Savings Patterns in the Expatriate Keralite Population During the Pandemic linked in the Github as well
