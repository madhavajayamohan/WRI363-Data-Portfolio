## Note for WRI363 Students or Teacher Who Look at This

My main assignment is the .ipynb file. Don't download it– just look at it through GitHub

I have all the data pieces explanations attached in my file as well. However, some of it might not
make sense unless you have the appropriate background in all the variables involved.

I advise reading through the Jupyter Notebooks Context and skimming through the Cleaning section
before looking at the other files.

For the misleading data piece, you might want to read the section Data Analysis without Normalization. 

For the data communication piece, I would advise reading the section Data Analysis with Normalization. 

The Cleaning section and any other sections are optional– although they are important parts of my Counter data piece, 
so maybe skim through them.
