## Note for WRI363 Students or Teacher Who Look at This

My main assignment is the .ipynb file. Don't download it– just look at it through GitHub

I advise the followed progression for this assignment

1. Read the Context first– this is pretty important
2. Look at the Counter Data piece explanation
3. Go to the section Data Analysis without Normalization. Go through that, and at the end you get the misleading Data Piece
4. Go to the section Data Analysis with Normalization. Go through that, and at the end you get the Communicating Data Piece

The Cleaning section and any other sections are optional– although they are important parts of my Counter data piece, so maybe skim through them.
